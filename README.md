<h2>InfiniteBackrooms</h2>

<p>
This is a Unity project for a VRChat world containing a procedurally-generated, infinite liminal space.<br>I've put it here for other people to learn from, or use for their own projects.<br>If you just want to try the world, the VRC world link is <a href="https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld_c92b276b-c002-4a83-a9ca-99456820abbb">right here!</a>
</p>

<h2>Project Setup</h2>
<p>
In order to get a working Unity project from this repository, you will first have to clone it (or download zip), and then simply add the folder to Unity Hub.<br>
However, there is two packages I've decided not not include in the repository to avoid potential licensing issues.<br>
You will need to manually import FIRST the <a href="https://vrchat.com/home/download">VRC SDK</a>, THEN <a href="https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp/releases/latest">UdonSharp</a>.<br>
After that, you should have a working Unity Project.

<h2>Conditions</h2>
<p>
You MAY use the files in this repository as a base to create your own world using the machanics provided by them.<br>
You MUST include proper credit to me for creating this base in the world, in a place easily noticable by players upon joining (i.e. a sign at spawn).<br>
This credit notice MUST include a link back to this GitHub repository.<br>
It is NOT required to make your derivative works open-source, but it is highly encouraged to contribute your improvements to this repository.
